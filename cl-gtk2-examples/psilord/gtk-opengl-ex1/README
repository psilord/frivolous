;; To deal with cl-gtk2-gtkglext, I had to manually add the path to
;; the asd file to my systems path and manually ask quicklisp to load
;; it. Apparently it doesn't build by default and it is turned off in
;; the quicklisp index. This means that in your ~quicklisp/local-projects
;; directory, make a symlink called gtk-glext to 
;; $HOME/quicklisp/dists/quicklisp/software/cl-gtk2-20120909-git/gtk-glext
;; and ensure the date is correct for your release of quicklisp.

;; To run:

(asdf:load-system :gtk-opengl-ex1)
(in-package :gtk-opengl-ex1)
(when * (main))
