This is the project "Pathogenesis Arcanum".

A game about world domination, asassination, virii, and the nanosized
robots that make it all possible. It is a schmup on a sphere.

The gist of the storyline is that you are controlling a nano robot. It is
hovering around/over different particles like amino acids, etc, and the body is
trying to destroy it what you are protecting/assembling. You have to destroy
the offenses the body sends against you, but then capture suitable pieces from
the destruction and assemble the virii/cancer cell/etc in the process. If you
fuck up, pieces can get blown off and you have to acquire them again.

You start off making virii or something, but keep working your way up in size
until you get to entire cells or greater. Different backdrops at that scale
could be cool looking. You're generally in a fluid, so things can go whizzing
by.  If you're protecting a cell, you can see it dividing as the time in the
level progresses and you're able to feed it the right chemicals and protect it
from the body's defenses.

You have repulsors, attractors, weapons, shields, the usual.
